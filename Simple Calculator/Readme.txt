- Explanation of the Code:

1. Frame and Components:

- A JFrame is created to hold all the components.
- A JTextField is used to display the input/output of the calculator.
- JButtons are used for each number (0-9) and operator (+, -, *, /, =, C).

2. ActionListener:

- The ButtonClickListener class listens for button clicks.
- Depending on the button clicked, it either appends the number to the text field, performs a calculation, or clears the screen.

3. Operators:

- The program supports four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- When = is clicked, the operation is performed, and the result is shown.

4. Clear (C):

- When C is clicked, the text field is cleared, and all stored values are reset.

- Running the Code:

- Copy and paste this code into a .java file (e.g., SimpleCalculator.java).
- Compile and run the Java program using

1. javac SimpleCalculator.java
2. java SimpleCalculator
3. The calculator GUI will appear, and you can perform basic arithmetic operations.

- Example Output:

- When you click buttons in the app, the display will show the input and results of arithmetic operations.
