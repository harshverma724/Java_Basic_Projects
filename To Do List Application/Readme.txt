1.Todo List Representation:

- We're using an ArrayList<String> to store the tasks. Each task is represented as a String.

2.Menu System:

- The showMenu method prints out the options available to the user. The user can view tasks, add new tasks, remove tasks, or exit the application.

3.View Tasks:

- The viewTasks method displays all tasks in the to-do list. If there are no tasks, it prints a message saying the list is empty.

4.Add a Task:

- The addTask method prompts the user to enter a task description and adds it to the list.

5.Remove a Task:

- The removeTask method asks the user for the task number to remove (1-based index). If the task number is valid, it removes the task from the list; otherwise, it shows an error message.

6.Loop:
